 Heavily optimized code to compute HOG features described in &quot;Histograms
 of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection&quot; by Dalal &amp; Triggs, CVPR05.
 This function is made largely obsolete by fhog, see fhog.m for details.

 If I has dimensions [hxw], the size of the computed feature vector H is
 floor([h/binSize w/binSize nOrients*4]). For each binSize x binSize
 region, computes a histogram of gradients, with each gradient quantized
 by its angle and weighed by its magnitude. For color images, the gradient
 is computed separately for each color channel and the one with maximum
 magnitude is used. The centered gradient is used except at boundaries
 (where uncentered gradient is used). Trilinear interpolation is used to
 place each gradient in the appropriate spatial and orientation bin.

 For each resulting histogram (with nOrients bins), four different
 normalizations are computed using adjacent histograms, resulting in a
 nOrients*4 length feature vector for each region. To compute the
 normalizations, first for each block of adjacent 2x2 histograms we
 compute their L2 norm (over all 4*nOrient bins). Each histogram (except
 at boundaries) thus has 4 different normalization values associated with
 it. Each histogram bin is then normalized by each of the 4 different L2
 norms, resulting in a 4 times expansion of the number of bins. Finally,
 any bin whose value is bigger than &quot;clip&quot; is set to &quot;clip&quot;.

 The computed features are NOT identical to those described in the CVPR05
 paper. Specifically, there is no Gaussian spatial window, and other minor
 details differ. The choices were made for speed of the resulting code:
 ~.008s for a 640x480x3 color image on a standard machine from 2011.

 This function is essentially a wrapper for calls to gradientMag()
 and gradientHist(). Specifically, it is equivalent to the following:
  [M,O] = gradientMag( I ); softBin = 1; useHog = 1;
  H = gradientHist(M,O,binSize,nOrients,softBin,useHog,clip);
 See gradientHist() for more general usage.

 This code requires SSE2 to compile and run (most modern Intel and AMD
 processors support SSE2). Please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2.

 USAGE
  H = hog( I, [binSize], [nOrients], [clip], [crop] )

 INPUTS
  I        - [hxw] color or grayscale input image (must have type single)
  binSize  - [8] spatial bin size
  nOrients - [9] number of orientation bins
  clip     - [.2] value at which to clip histogram bins
  crop     - [0] if true crop boundaries

 OUTPUTS
  H        - [h/binSize w/binSize nOrients*4] computed hog features

 EXAMPLE
  I=imResample(single(imread('peppers.png')),[480 640])/255;
  tic, for i=1:125, H=hog(I,8,9); end; toc % ~1s for 125 iterations
  figure(1); im(I); V=hogDraw(H,25); figure(2); im(V)
