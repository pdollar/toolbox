% Actually root is necessarily the element whos UID is 1, by
% construction. However, xml_parser should return a tree with a ROOT
% element with as many children as needed but only ONE *element* child
% who would be the real root (and this method should return the UID of
% this element).

uid = 1;

% Update:
% xml_parser has been modified (not as explained above) to handle the
% case when several nodes are at the top level of the XML.
% Example: <!-- beginning --><root>blah blah</root><!-- end -->
% Now root is the first element node of the tree.

% Look for the first element in the XML Tree
for i=1:length(tree)
	if strcmp(get(tree,i,'type'),'element')
		uid = i;
		break
	end
